Antenna are key component of any wireless system. 
An antenna is a device that receives or transmit electromagnetic waves. 
An antenna is a one type of transducer that converts electromagnetic energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. 
An antenna that is formed out a patch of conductive material on a dielectric surface is known as a patch antenna. 
The dielectric material is mounted on a ground plane, where the ground plane supports the whole structure. 
Also, the excitation to the antenna is provided using feed lines connected through the patch. 
As it is formed using a microstrip technique by fabricating on a printed circuit board thus is also known as Microstrip antenna or printed antenna. 
Generally, patch antennas are considered as lowprofile antennas and are used for microwave frequency applications having frequency greater.
Antenna of Micro-strip patch is the foremost type of published antenna. It has a major part in wireless communication systems. 
Fabrication can be fluently done using micro strip antenna. Ground plane, substrate a radiating patch are there in a structure of this antenna.
Patch confines defines radiating point of antenna. 
Length and range parameters are used for representing patch.
Material used to make substrate is FR4 are durable for a long range of frequency. The frequency ranges of antenna is 2.4 GHz.
